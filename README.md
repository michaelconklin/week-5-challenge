# week-5-challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This weeks challenge was to create a work day scheduler to help plan your day, I could not get it to fully function but I am comfident in the JavaScript portion. This project should allow you to input your schedule and even after refreshing the page, it will be saved.
